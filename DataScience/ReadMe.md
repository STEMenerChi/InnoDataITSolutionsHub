# Data Science Projects in R

Welcome to the Data Science folder, home to two exciting data analysis projects written in R. Here, you'll find detailed insights and code for two distinct projects: "Cancer Liver Forecast" and "Movie Lens Rating Prediction."

## Project 1: Cancer Liver Forecast

In the "Cancer Liver Forecast" project, we explore predictive modeling techniques to forecast the likelihood of liver cancer based on various medical and demographic factors. This project aims to provide valuable insights into early cancer detection and risk assessment.

### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Building and fine-tuning predictive models
- Performance evaluation and visualization
- Recommendations for further research and improvement

The "Movie Lens Rating Prediction" project focuses on creating a recommendation system to predict user ratings for movies. Using collaborative filtering and machine learning techniques, we aim to provide movie recommendations tailored to individual preferences.

### Key Features:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Collaborative filtering algorithms
- Model training and evaluation
- Personalized movie recommendations
